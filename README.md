# -FIRST-PROJECT-Simple-Rotating-Items-Vending-Machine
Made by: Ziver

I made this code as my first python project(high school) and decided to upload a log of all major projects starting with this one.

This code was made with the coding platform Relpit, All of the code is mine except for some comments made by a classmate on some pieces of code.

All other files in the repository other than "main.py" and this file are from Relpits interface and to be honest I have no clue what there purpose is. I will get back on this later and ask some of my mentors!
